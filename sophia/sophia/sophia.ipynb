    "### Sophia Optimization Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sophia optimization algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization technique used to solve complex optimization problems. It is based on the collective behavior of biological entities, such as animals, plants, or even microorganisms, that exhibit intelligent behavior in their search for food, shelter, or mates. The Sophia algorithm leverages these natural strategies to find optimal solutions in a multidimensional search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features\n",
    "- **Swarm Intelligence**: Sophia relies on the collective behavior of a group of agents (particles) to explore the search space.\n",
    "- **Adaptive Learning**: Each agent adapts its movement based on its own experience and the experiences of its neighbors.\n",
    "- **Global and Local Search**: Balances exploration (global search) and exploitation (local search) to efficiently converge to an optimal solution.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Parameters such as inertia weight, cognitive and social coefficients dynamically adjust to enhance performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Steps\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Initialize a population of agents with random positions and velocities in the search space.\n",
    "2. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the fitness of each agent based on the objective function.\n",
    "3. **Update Best Values**: Identify the personal best position for each agent and the global best position among all agents.\n",
    "4. **Velocity and Position Update**: Update the velocity and position of each agent based on its personal best position and the global best position.\n",
    "5. **Termination**: Repeat the evaluation and update steps until a termination criterion (e.g., maximum iterations or convergence threshold) is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "- **Velocity Update**: \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  v_{i}(t+1) = w \\cdot v_{i}(t) + c_{1} \\cdot r_{1} \\cdot (p_{i} - x_{i}(t)) + c_{2} \\cdot r_{2} \\cdot (g - x_{i}(t))\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- **Position Update**: \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  x_{i}(t+1) = x_{i}(t) + v_{i}(t+1)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ v_{i}(t) $: Velocity of agent $ i $ at time $ t $.\n",
    "- $ x_{i}(t) $: Position of agent $ i $ at time $ t $.\n",
    "- $ w $: Inertia weight.\n",
    "- $ c_{1}, c_{2} $: Cognitive and social coefficients.\n",
    "- $ r_{1}, r_{2} $: Random numbers between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- $ p_{i} $: Personal best position of agent $ i $.\n",
    "- $ g $: Global best position of the swarm.\n",
